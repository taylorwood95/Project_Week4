Python Project - Travel Bucket List Planner

Brief:

Build an app to track someone's travel adventures.

MVP:

- The app should allow the user to track countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited.
- The user should be able to create and edit countries
- The user should be able to create and delete entries for cities
- The app should allow the user to mark destinations as visited or still to see

Possible Extensions:
- Have separate pages for destinations visited and those still to visit
- Search for destination by continent, city or country
- Any other ideas you might come up with
